# AlfredWorkflowSwiftPlayground
A simple Alfred workflow to jump start a Xcode Swift playground to immediately kick-off coding an idea.

## Usage
Either type just the command `play` to create a playground on the `desktop` targeted for `iOS` named `MyPlayground`.

Or `play {LOCATION} {PLATFORM} {FILE_NAME}`

If youâ€™re going on with the above customised command, argument order is important! A simple way to remember the above command is `play at {LOCATION} with {PLATFORM} on file named {FILE_NAME}`
